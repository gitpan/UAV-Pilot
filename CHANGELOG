Revision history for perl module UAV::Pilot

0.6 2013-??-??

[EventHandler Interface]
- UAV::Pilot::SDL::EventHandler moved to UAV::Pilot::EventHandler
- UAV::Pilot::Events based on previous UAV::Pilot::SDL::Events, except it 
  doesn't do anything for SDL
- UAV::Pilot::SDL::Events changed to an EventHandler
- All other EventHandler objects and bin/uav* scripts updated to reflect this 
  change

[Controller and Driver Interface]
- Rename UAV::Pilot::Driver::ARDrone to UAV::Pilot::ARDrone::Driver
- Rename UAV::Pilot::Control::ARDrone to UAV::Pilot::ARDrone::Control
- All the other modules under those namespaces were renamed accordingly

[Other Changes]
- In UAV::Pilot::Control, change the 'sender' param to 'driver'
- Stack handlers passed to UAV::Pilot::Video::H264Decoder.  Note the API change 
  of 'display' to 'displays'
- Stack handlers passed to UAV::Pilot::Driver::ARDrone::Video.  Note the API 
  change of 'handler' to 'handlers'
- 'uav' shell handles dumping video to file while displaying it at the same time
- Implement 'NavCollector' to receive nav packets as they're read from the driver
- SDLNavDisplay implemented as a NavCollector rather than an EventHandler
- When we get a bad PaVE header on the video stream, fast forward to the next
  one.  This helps recover the video stream gracefully.  The video will be 
  messed up until the next keyframe, but at least it keeps going.


0.5 2013-07-31

- Real-time video implemented (this is the big one)
- VideoHandler and FileDump moved into UAV::Pilot::Video namespace.  Handler 
  role now named "H264Handler".
- Joystick buttons can be mapped to actions
- Joystick module can take a path to a conf file
- bin/uav gets an --iface option for a network interface for binding


0.4 2013-07-04

- Dump video to file
    - If using mplayer to show the file, set the FPS manually with 
      "mplayer -fps 30 /path/to/file.h264"
- Rename anything that starts an event loop to init_event_loop()
- Joystick to UAV control number conversion decoupled from ARDrone specifics
- Add methods to UAV::Pilot::Control::ARDrone for userbox nav data and picture 
  taking
