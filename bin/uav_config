=head1 SYNOPSIS

    uav_config \
        --host 192.168.1.1 \
        --port 1234 \
        --key video_codec_fps \
        --value 30

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Set a config key on the UAV.  A list of keys can be found in the section "Constants" -> 
"Configuration" in the docs for C<UAV::Pilot::ARDrone::Driver>.  To set a C<--key> option, 
take off the C<ARDRONE_CONFIG_> at the start of the config key name.  For instance, to 
set C<ARDRONE_CONFIG_VIDEO_CODEC_FPS>, you would instead set C<video_codec_fps> (lowercase 
is OK).
